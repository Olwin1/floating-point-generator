# Simple Script for Generating Floating Point Numbers in Two's Compliment

This is in the format for A-Level **OCR** Computer Science I don't know what other exam boards use so probably best you double check if they use this format.
I found out the hard way that floating point numbers normally aren't actually written in two's compliment instead they're in sign & magnitude so this is *Non-Standard*.
So why do we have to learn a Non-Standard format? Now that's a good question. Who Knows. OCR almost certainly doesn't

This took me embarassingly long to make...

>Please use in **Python 3.10+** as it does use switch-case (match in python) which does not exist in previous versions for some reason which is truly baffling.  

## How To Run
This script only depends on NumPy for converting the floats into human readable strings instead of scientific notation.  To install NumPy you can ether run:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
or
`pip install numpy`
Whichever you prefer.
